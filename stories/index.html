                  <h2 class="storyfontcolor">Two-year programs, Certificates, and Oregon’s “Middle 40%” Goal</h2>
                  <h4>Duncan Wyse</h4>
                  <p>Oregonians understand what it means to increase high school graduation rates – the “100” in 40/40/100 – and we know a lot about <a href="http://dropoutprevention.org/effective-strategies/">how to do it</a>. Schools, parents, and students themselves know they bear much of the responsibility. Engaged communities also help.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div id="storyfourexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>We also know what <a href="http://completecollege.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4-Year-Myth.pdf">raising degree completion rates</a> in four-year colleges and universities is about – the first “40” in 40/40/100. Again, students and schools play primary roles, and increasingly, so do the nonprofit and business communities. Oregon colleges and universities have proven they can make college accessible – especially among low-income students and students of color – with the help of state incentives. So one can imagine them also adjusting to the state’s <a href="http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2015/04/10/higher-ed-commission-approves-new-funding-model/25553475/">new approach to funding</a>, which ties resources to <i>degree completion</i>, rather than to student enrollment, <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/audits/Documents/2013-09.pdf">as had been the case since 1999</a>.</p>
                <p>But in between, at the level of certificates and two-year degrees, we find the middle “40” in 40/40/100. And things are a little fuzzy.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What exactly is the intended goal for the 40%? There’s not much detail in the enabling legislation (SB 253, 2011) which reads, “40 percent shall have earned an associate’s degree or postsecondary credential.”</li>
                  <li>We know what an associate’s degree is, but what is a <i>credential?</i> Subsequent policy briefs and summaries have used the language of <a href="http://oregonlearns.org/oregons-challenge/the-40-40-20-goal/">certificates</a>, or even <a href="http://www.cocc.edu/institutional-effectiveness-archive/achievement-compacts/achievement-compacts---oregon-s-40-40-20/">“meaningful” certificates</a>. Together with badges, two-year degrees, and industry certifications, certificates are awarded by a <a href="http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEGL15-10a2.pdf">vast array</a> of training providers, from public community or technical colleges to private career schools to state agencies – which award apprenticeship certificates and licenses to qualified individuals in a range of skill areas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Which ones should count as credentials under Oregon’s policy?</p>
                <p>“That’s the question,” suggests Duncan Wyse, President of the Oregon Business Council. “We don’t really know. We’re starting with a broad understanding and we expect to become more specific over time...as systems begin to shift toward delivering skills measured by proficiency, not just time spent in the classroom.”</p>
                <p>This uncertainty is not unique to Oregon – and could be seen as a positive. The education and skills training market is dynamic. But it is also regulated, governed, or otherwise influenced by policy in a myriad of different ways across campuses, communities, and states – resulting in different credit and articulation agreements among and between different schools. This makes it challenging for students to navigate their way to the right provider of the right skills, and to aggregate their learning in ways that the market recognizes and rewards.</p>
                <p>“The problem is that students get completely confused. They see lists of classes and credits that transfer or do not…[and communicate acquired skills in different ways.]. So the big model now is <a href="http://doingwhatmatters.cccco.edu/portals/6/docs/Building%20Guided%20Pathways%20to%20Success%20-%20EAB%20Report%20FINAL.pdf">‘guided pathways’</a> [and connected credentialing systems.]”</p>
                <p>A common credentials framework and the idea of linked <a href="http://www.jff.org/publications/portable-stackable-credentials-new-education-model-industry-specific-career-pathways">“stackable” credentials</a> (including certificates) that enable students to turn bits of learning over time into degrees that have value in the labor market is a priority of the <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USED/bulletins/b3f6c0">US Department of Education</a>, the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ETA20131932.htm">US Department of Labor</a>, and <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/resources/connecting-credentials">major national foundations</a> and <a href="http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/files/2014-03-21-Stackable-Credentials-Paper-FINAL.pdf">nongovernmental organizations</a>. The same is true for policy makers <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GAC/2014/WEF_GAC_Employment_MatchingSkillsLabourMarket_Report_2014.pdf">outside the US</a>, as schools (and the companies that hire their alumni) operate increasingly internationally.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>The number of certificates awarded has skyrocketed more than 800 percent over the past 30 years. In 1984, less than 2 percent of adults 18 and older had a certificate as their highest educational attainment; by 2009, the percentage had grown to almost 12%.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Wyse sees a coming wave of innovation within community colleges and other certificate providers. “It’s a journey,” he argues. “We need a lot more nimbleness in the credential system...but it will mean new players and changing roles.”</p>

                <h4>Why the Rise of Credentials?</h4>

                <p>The economy is one reason.</p>
                <p>Wyse reflects, “It was once possible to leave high school and go out and get a job that could support a very nice life … and not that long ago. Higher education was a giant sorting system but people who didn’t go to college could still do well.”</p>
                <p>Things have <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/">changed</a>.</p>
                <p>But Wyse says it is more than fear of economic peril that’s driving the push for higher skills and credentials, at least in Oregon. “It is a shift in values...an expression of the belief that everyone can learn and achieve much higher standards than we’ve built systems for...but they don’t all learn in the same way [or on the same timeline].”</p>
                <p>“We need an educational system that meets a much wider range of needs – one that can deliver on the promise of preparing every Oregonian for success in the 21st Century.”</p>
                <p>A credentialing system, supported by smart assessments that insure proficiency rather than validate time in the classroom, offers the promise of greater flexibility in education and training and greater transparency around skills in the labor market. Doing this right could make learning work better for people currently disadvantaged by traditional approaches – like students who are working, married, parenting, or otherwise <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/web/97578e.asp">non-traditional</a> and who now comprise the <a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2012/03/opinion/steven-bell/nontraditional-students-are-the-new-majority-from-the-bell-tower/#_">majority of students</a> participating in post-secondary education. It could also help diversify the workforce in STEM and other fields that have not been accessible to women and people of color.</p>

                <h4>How Does Oregon Stack Up?</h4>

                <p>If the goal is for 40% of us to hold certificates or two-year degrees by 2025, where are we now? We’ve got some data problems - we can and have measured education and skills attainment in different ways at different intervals. This will likely be an issue for some time to come as we make needed changes at both policy and operational levels. But despite marginal differences, the data do point in the same direction: we’ve got a ways to go.</p>
                <p>Oregon’s <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/COO/Ten/docs/educationoutcome.pdf">ten-year plan</a> – a 2012 vision document that has guided education budgeting and policy decisions since –  used 2010 data to establish a baseline of 18% (17% among younger Oregonians ages 25-34). A <a href="http://www.economicmodeling.com/2013/02/21/some-college-no-degree-u-s-cities-that-lag-and-excel-in-degree-attainment/">2013 EMSI study</a> used the criteria “some college” as a proxy for middle skills and found that 26% of Oregonians meet this threshold, placing the the Oregon at the high end of state rankings.</p>
                <p>Our own cohort shown in the Education Pathways tool shows that 2,125 (of 41,603) have earned two-year degrees or certificates as their highest educational credential – or 5% of that cohort. There are caveats here – these students are in their mid-twenties, giving them plenty of time to continue to learn, and because our data only indicates the highest credential, it’s possible that four-year degree earners also hold two-year degrees or certificates and may have appeared in a different category if we had analyzed the data before they continued on to a four-year program.</p>
                <p>OMG THERE'S NO SANKEY PICTURE HERE YET OMGWTFBBQ</p>
                <p>Perhaps more concerning are the inequities revealed by the data. Students in poverty appear to have had much more difficulty achieving credentials, earning just 15% of two year degrees and 21% of certificates, despite comprising 31% of the students in the cohort. These students were overrepresented among those whose highest credential was a high school diploma (or no diploma) – 88% of students in poverty are represented in these two groups compared to 67% of students not in poverty.</p>
                <p>Even more stark inequities exist by race and ethnicity. For example, of the 777 Native American students in the cohort, a high school diploma is the highest credential 91% have achieved – and 277 of them (35%) fell short of this. Fourteen of these students – less than 2% – achieved a two-year degree. This is a <i>great distance</i> from the goal of 40%.</p>

                <h4>Where From Here?</h4>

                <p>Wyse expresses enthusiasm for the changes the state is making to increase Oregonian’s educational attainment beyond high school. “The good news is, we now – for the first time – have a single body focused on that question – the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.” The <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/HigherEd/Pages/about.aspx">commission</a> was established as part of the package of educational reforms introduced in 2011 and is charged with bringing together what had been a disjointed collection of governing boards and administrative agencies into a coherent whole – for the long run.</p>
                <p>“We need to understand that to achieve a major change in result we need to change the system. We need a broad and deep conversation about what teaching and learning... should look like in the 21st century.”</p>
                <p>It’s time for such a conversation.</p>

                  <h2 class="storyfontcolor">The Winding Educational Pathway of Shabab Mirza</h2>
                  <h4>Shabab Mirza</h4>
                  <p>Nearing the end of his junior year in college, Shabab realized that the bachelor’s degree awaiting him might not be enough to secure a job. Over the years, he had seen quite a few recent graduates turned down from one position after another despite meeting all academic requirements. Worried that a similar struggle lay in store for him, Shabab decided that he needed to take a detour in his education pathway.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div id="storyfiveexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>“Most of the graduates I talked to were very smart and definitely competent – and they admit that their college education helped them excel in their professions later on”, explains Shabab, now a freshly minted graduate from Reed college. “What college didn't prepare them for was landing their first jobs.”</p>
                <p>This plight of the recent graduate is not limited to the few people Shabab happened to encounter. Sifting through then-current headlines paints a grim story for those with “Frayed Prospects, Despite a Degree”, frequently categorized as “Young, Educated and Jobless”. Annual reports from the Economic Policy Institute indicate that the unemployment rate among young college graduates has steadily declined from 8.8% to 7.2% between 2013 and 2015. However, these rates are still higher than the country's overall unemployment rates in the respective years as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: 6.7% in 2013 and 5.6% in 2015 (latest data available for both years).</p>
                <p>High unemployment among young people can be attributed to a number of factors – one of the more common ones being that these grads are simply unlucky, idled by an economy that hasn't fully recovered from the Great Recession. Many recent grads expect to face numerous challenges getting a job, keeping it, and moving up.</p>
                <p>Shabab identified another challenge.</p>
                <p>Whatever his potential employers find impressive about his resume, Shabab was pretty confident it was not going to be his GPA. Research presented by Rojstaczer et al estimates that the average college GPA has been rising at a rate of 0.15 per decade since the Vietnam war, when flunking out of school meant enlisting in the draft. Apart from making the GPA a vague metric in itself, this phenomenon adds pressure upon graduates from schools that either attempt to curb grade inflation or manage to restrict it to the lower end of the spectrum -- schools like Reed. Shabab decided that he needed to get some work experience that could serve as a better signal of his abilities than his grades.</p>
                <p>At Reed, he found numerous grants, fellowships and other resources to pursue internships over the summer. However, since Reed did not provided academic credit for such work, it would not be feasible to attempt to find an internship during the semester.</p>
                <p>There was another problem.</p>
                <p>Originally from Bangladesh, Shabab is an international student. As any other international student, he is well versed in US Immigration 101 – if a job is not directly a part of his academic program, he does not have work authorization for it during the semester.</p>
                <p>Shabab laid out his plans for the next two years: he was going to take time off from Reed, enroll into an associates degree program at Portland Community College (PCC), and come back to Reed to graduate in 2015, when he expected the economy to be in slightly better shape.</p>
                <p>“One of the first things I noticed when I started at PCC was that everyone was always reminding me to finish my degree” says Shabab. At first, he found it strange to see posters across campus and programs designed specially to encourage students to stay on track to complete their degrees. He later realized that this was because there is a large number of students that don't stick around long enough to get their degrees.</p>
                <p>For some, it is likely because they need to juggle the full time commitment of being a student, with the many other full time commitments they already have as employees and parents. For others, including Shabab, going to community college isn't really about the degree.</p>
                <p>“Many of my classmates were enrolled just so they could get a particular certificate, or to learn a specific skill they needed to advance their careers.”</p>
                <p>There were many options for students to tailor their coursework to get exactly what they needed – if you don't want to take the whole 2 year associates degree in accounting, you could still take the 4-month certification. Having enrolled with the intention of getting work experience, degree completion wasn't at the top of Shabab's priorities. He applied to part-time jobs in Portland, which seemed to not be very abundant. Moreover, he found himself competing in an “over-qualified” pool of candidates – those with master’s degrees and PhDs.</p>
                <p>He soon began working at Business for Culture and Arts as a research intern. After that, he found another internship at Mercy Corp. Both of these were structured around PCC's Cooperative Education program, for which Shabab says he has a lot of respect. Additional structure and regulations were also in place due to his international student status. Mainly intended to protect students from being exploited by employers, these regulations actually made for a very productive working environment for Shabab.</p>
                <p>“Since the program required that I have specific learning objectives at my internship – I couldn't be assigned the same task everyday, I had to legally be learning something new every few weeks.”</p>
                <p>At the end of the year, Shabab completed his Associate of General Studies along with gathering extensive work experience, and forming invaluable professional connections. He attributes the summer job he was offered soon after at Business for Culture and Arts directly to his experience at PCC. After four more months as a project associate at BCA as well as a couple of months as a Research Services Intern at Americans for the Arts in Washington DC, he returned to Reed to complete his degree.</p>
                <p>This May, he received his BA in Economics from Reed along with the other graduates from the class of 2015. Having formally entered the post-graduation job hunt, he says that the experiences and connections he built during his year at PCC have definitely helped him. He acknowledges that not everyone has the privilege of being able to afford spending additional years in school. But for those who can he recommends community college as an excellent way to get certifications and working experience, while getting quite a few pre-requisite courses out of the way. He says that if he ever has a kid, his advice to them would definitely be to start at community college before beginning their bachelor’s degree.</p>

                <h4>Gerald Scruchions</h4>
                <p>In May 2015, Oregonians woke up to an alarming headline: “<a href="http://www.kgw.com/story/news/education/2015/05/13/report-oregon-graduation-rates-holding-us-back-from-goal/27270597/">Oregon has Worst Graduation Rate in US.</a>” It <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2015/01/oregon_posts_worst_graduation.html">provoked</a> a mix of outrage, embarrassment, and resignation, and raised serious questions about why so many young people were not making it through high school and what was being done about it.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="storysevenexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>Gerald Scrutchions is an <a href="http://www.avid.org/avid-college-readiness-system.ashx">AVID</a> (Advancement Via Individual Determination) instructor and social studies teacher at <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/roosevelt/">Roosevelt High School</a>. AVID is a college preparatory program offered at 15 schools in the Portland Public Schools district.</p>
                <p>“It’s about culture,” explains Gerald, now in his second year at Roosevelt, “we’re trying – schoolwide – to teach the skills students need to be college and career ready so they have good options available to them when they graduate.” The skills training – emphasizing writing, inquiry, critical reading, collaboration, and organization – are complemented by hands-on college and financial-aid research and field trips to colleges, universities, and workplaces. “It emphasizes purpose…and learning in ways that build proficiency over time.”</p>
                <p>We know these things do create pathways to enrollment in college or career training. AVID has an enviable success rate nationally, and in Portland, the first high school class to have completed the program in 2014 (Madison High School) reported a <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/departments/curriculum/2433.htm">100% graduation rate</a>.</p>
                <p>But a lot can get in the way: the AVID approach may not be reinforced at home and poverty, parenthood, and competing priorities – including sports – can undermine both teacher and student efforts. Programs like AVID may not be enough.</p>
                <p>When we asked Gerald to name one thing that we had not yet discussed that had the potential to really help his students thrive, he replied immediately and with passion.</p>
                <p>“Food health.”</p>
                <p>That’s when things got really interesting.</p>
                <p>“Roosevelt students depend on the school as a source of nutrition – nearly 100% qualify for free- or reduced-price lunch. What we offer is just not good enough,” lamented Gerald. “So they don’t eat it, they go to McDonald’s or eat from snack carts.”</p>
                <p>“We see kids eating hot fries for breakfast and then falling asleep at 10 in the morning.”</p>
                <p>Gerald argued that <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/bond/">school modernization</a> – a <a href="http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/213404-71878-group-says-pps-fumbles-roosevelt-hs-modernization">controversial process</a> Roosevelt is in the middle of – should include improving food services for students. “We have these amazing food carts all over the city that offer better, healthier options, and could generate interest in food systems, culinary careers, or entrepreneurship – even science in the context of the new STEM [Science Technology Engineering, and Math] lab.”</p>
                <p>Gerald is spearheading a team to find ways to repurpose what is slated to be a fenced-in, sod-covered patch under the modernization plan, and turn it into raised beds – in the short term so that students can anticipate and help design the opportunities this might create. Portland maintains at least <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/nutrition/PPS_Edible-Gardens_4-2010.pdf">40 public school community gardens</a>, but all are located at elementary schools.</p>
                <p>“A lot of our problems would be solved if we just figured out better ways to feed our kids. And growing things, good food – this is part of Oregon’s heritage.”</p>
                <p>Growing food could also make STEM(s) very real.</p>
