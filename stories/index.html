                  <h2 class="storyfontcolor">Two-year programs, Certificates, and Oregon’s “Middle 40%” Goal</h2>
                  <h4>Duncan Wyse</h4>
                  <p>Oregonians understand what it means to increase high school graduation rates – the “100” in 40/40/100 – and we know a lot about <a href="http://dropoutprevention.org/effective-strategies/">how to do it</a>. Schools, parents, and students themselves know they bear much of the responsibility. Engaged communities also help.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div id="storyfourexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>We also know what <a href="http://completecollege.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4-Year-Myth.pdf">raising degree completion rates</a> in four-year colleges and universities is about – the first “40” in 40/40/100. Again, students and schools play primary roles, and increasingly, so do the nonprofit and business communities. Oregon colleges and universities have proven they can make college accessible – especially among low-income students and students of color – with the help of state incentives. So one can imagine them also adjusting to the state’s <a href="http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2015/04/10/higher-ed-commission-approves-new-funding-model/25553475/">new approach to funding</a>, which ties resources to <i>degree completion</i>, rather than to student enrollment, <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/audits/Documents/2013-09.pdf">as had been the case since 1999</a>.</p>
                <p>But in between, at the level of certificates and two-year degrees, we find the middle “40” in 40/40/100. And things are a little fuzzy.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What exactly is the intended goal for the 40%? There’s not much detail in the enabling legislation (SB 253, 2011) which reads, “40 percent shall have earned an associate’s degree or postsecondary credential.”</li>
                  <li>We know what an associate’s degree is, but what is a <i>credential?</i> Subsequent policy briefs and summaries have used the language of <a href="http://oregonlearns.org/oregons-challenge/the-40-40-20-goal/">certificates</a>, or even <a href="http://www.cocc.edu/institutional-effectiveness-archive/achievement-compacts/achievement-compacts---oregon-s-40-40-20/">“meaningful” certificates</a>. Together with badges, two-year degrees, and industry certifications, certificates are awarded by a <a href="http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEGL15-10a2.pdf">vast array</a> of training providers, from public community or technical colleges to private career schools to state agencies – which award apprenticeship certificates and licenses to qualified individuals in a range of skill areas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Which ones should count as credentials under Oregon’s policy?</p>
                <p>“That’s the question,” suggests Duncan Wyse, President of the Oregon Business Council. “We don’t really know. We’re starting with a broad understanding and we expect to become more specific over time...as systems begin to shift toward delivering skills measured by proficiency, not just time spent in the classroom.”</p>
                <p>This uncertainty is not unique to Oregon – and could be seen as a positive. The education and skills training market is dynamic. But it is also regulated, governed, or otherwise influenced by policy in a myriad of different ways across campuses, communities, and states – resulting in different credit and articulation agreements among and between different schools. This makes it challenging for students to navigate their way to the right provider of the right skills, and to aggregate their learning in ways that the market recognizes and rewards.</p>
                <p>“The problem is that students get completely confused. They see lists of classes and credits that transfer or do not…[and communicate acquired skills in different ways.]. So the big model now is <a href="http://doingwhatmatters.cccco.edu/portals/6/docs/Building%20Guided%20Pathways%20to%20Success%20-%20EAB%20Report%20FINAL.pdf">‘guided pathways’</a> [and connected credentialing systems.]”</p>
                <p>A common credentials framework and the idea of linked <a href="http://www.jff.org/publications/portable-stackable-credentials-new-education-model-industry-specific-career-pathways">“stackable” credentials</a> (including certificates) that enable students to turn bits of learning over time into degrees that have value in the labor market is a priority of the <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USED/bulletins/b3f6c0">US Department of Education</a>, the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ETA20131932.htm">US Department of Labor</a>, and <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/resources/connecting-credentials">major national foundations</a> and <a href="http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/files/2014-03-21-Stackable-Credentials-Paper-FINAL.pdf">nongovernmental organizations</a>. The same is true for policy makers <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GAC/2014/WEF_GAC_Employment_MatchingSkillsLabourMarket_Report_2014.pdf">outside the US</a>, as schools (and the companies that hire their alumni) operate increasingly internationally.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>The number of certificates awarded has skyrocketed more than 800 percent over the past 30 years. In 1984, less than 2 percent of adults 18 and older had a certificate as their highest educational attainment; by 2009, the percentage had grown to almost 12%.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Wyse sees a coming wave of innovation within community colleges and other certificate providers. “It’s a journey,” he argues. “We need a lot more nimbleness in the credential system...but it will mean new players and changing roles.”</p>

                <h4>Why the Rise of Credentials?</h4>

                <p>The economy is one reason.</p>
                <p>Wyse reflects, “It was once possible to leave high school and go out and get a job that could support a very nice life … and not that long ago. Higher education was a giant sorting system but people who didn’t go to college could still do well.”</p>
                <p>Things have <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/">changed</a>.</p>
                <p>But Wyse says it is more than fear of economic peril that’s driving the push for higher skills and credentials, at least in Oregon. “It is a shift in values...an expression of the belief that everyone can learn and achieve much higher standards than we’ve built systems for...but they don’t all learn in the same way [or on the same timeline].”</p>
                <p>“We need an educational system that meets a much wider range of needs – one that can deliver on the promise of preparing every Oregonian for success in the 21st Century.”</p>
                <p>A credentialing system, supported by smart assessments that insure proficiency rather than validate time in the classroom, offers the promise of greater flexibility in education and training and greater transparency around skills in the labor market. Doing this right could make learning work better for people currently disadvantaged by traditional approaches – like students who are working, married, parenting, or otherwise <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/web/97578e.asp">non-traditional</a> and who now comprise the <a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2012/03/opinion/steven-bell/nontraditional-students-are-the-new-majority-from-the-bell-tower/#_">majority of students</a> participating in post-secondary education. It could also help diversify the workforce in STEM and other fields that have not been accessible to women and people of color.</p>

                <h4>How Does Oregon Stack Up?</h4>

                <p>If the goal is for 40% of us to hold certificates or two-year degrees by 2025, where are we now? We’ve got some data problems - we can and have measured education and skills attainment in different ways at different intervals. This will likely be an issue for some time to come as we make needed changes at both policy and operational levels. But despite marginal differences, the data do point in the same direction: we’ve got a ways to go.</p>
                <p>Oregon’s <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/COO/Ten/docs/educationoutcome.pdf">ten-year plan</a> – a 2012 vision document that has guided education budgeting and policy decisions since –  used 2010 data to establish a baseline of 18% (17% among younger Oregonians ages 25-34). A <a href="http://www.economicmodeling.com/2013/02/21/some-college-no-degree-u-s-cities-that-lag-and-excel-in-degree-attainment/">2013 EMSI study</a> used the criteria “some college” as a proxy for middle skills and found that 26% of Oregonians meet this threshold, placing the the Oregon at the high end of state rankings.</p>
                <p>Our own cohort shown in the Education Pathways tool shows that 2,125 (of 41,603) have earned two-year degrees or certificates as their highest educational credential – or 5% of that cohort. There are caveats here – these students are in their mid-twenties, giving them plenty of time to continue to learn, and because our data only indicates the highest credential, it’s possible that four-year degree earners also hold two-year degrees or certificates and may have appeared in a different category if we had analyzed the data before they continued on to a four-year program.</p>
                <p>OMG THERE'S NO SANKEY PICTURE HERE YET OMGWTFBBQ</p>
                <p>Perhaps more concerning are the inequities revealed by the data. Students in poverty appear to have had much more difficulty achieving credentials, earning just 15% of two year degrees and 21% of certificates, despite comprising 31% of the students in the cohort. These students were overrepresented among those whose highest credential was a high school diploma (or no diploma) – 88% of students in poverty are represented in these two groups compared to 67% of students not in poverty.</p>
                <p>Even more stark inequities exist by race and ethnicity. For example, of the 777 Native American students in the cohort, a high school diploma is the highest credential 91% have achieved – and 277 of them (35%) fell short of this. Fourteen of these students – less than 2% – achieved a two-year degree. This is a <i>great distance</i> from the goal of 40%.</p>

                <h4>Where From Here?</h4>

                <p>Wyse expresses enthusiasm for the changes the state is making to increase Oregonian’s educational attainment beyond high school. “The good news is, we now – for the first time – have a single body focused on that question – the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.” The <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/HigherEd/Pages/about.aspx">commission</a> was established as part of the package of educational reforms introduced in 2011 and is charged with bringing together what had been a disjointed collection of governing boards and administrative agencies into a coherent whole – for the long run.</p>
                <p>“We need to understand that to achieve a major change in result we need to change the system. We need a broad and deep conversation about what teaching and learning... should look like in the 21st century.”</p>
                <p>It’s time for such a conversation.</p>

                  <h2 class="storyfontcolor">The Winding Educational Pathway of Shabab Mirza</h2>
                  <h4>Shabab Mirza</h4>
                  <p>Nearing the end of his junior year in college, Shabab realized that the bachelor’s degree awaiting him might not be enough to secure a job. Over the years, he had seen quite a few recent graduates turned down from one position after another despite meeting all academic requirements. Worried that a similar struggle lay in store for him, Shabab decided that he needed to take a detour in his education pathway.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div id="storyfiveexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>“Most of the graduates I talked to were very smart and definitely competent – and they admit that their college education helped them excel in their professions later on”, explains Shabab, now a freshly minted graduate from Reed college. “What college didn't prepare them for was landing their first jobs.”</p>
                <p>This plight of the recent graduate is not limited to the few people Shabab happened to encounter. Sifting through then-current headlines paints a grim story for those with “Frayed Prospects, Despite a Degree”, frequently categorized as “Young, Educated and Jobless”. Annual reports from the Economic Policy Institute indicate that the unemployment rate among young college graduates has steadily declined from 8.8% to 7.2% between 2013 and 2015. However, these rates are still higher than the country's overall unemployment rates in the respective years as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: 6.7% in 2013 and 5.6% in 2015 (latest data available for both years).</p>
                <p>High unemployment among young people can be attributed to a number of factors – one of the more common ones being that these grads are simply unlucky, idled by an economy that hasn't fully recovered from the Great Recession. Many recent grads expect to face numerous challenges getting a job, keeping it, and moving up.</p>
                <p>Shabab identified another challenge.</p>
                <p>Whatever his potential employers find impressive about his resume, Shabab was pretty confident it was not going to be his GPA. Research presented by Rojstaczer et al estimates that the average college GPA has been rising at a rate of 0.15 per decade since the Vietnam war, when flunking out of school meant enlisting in the draft. Apart from making the GPA a vague metric in itself, this phenomenon adds pressure upon graduates from schools that either attempt to curb grade inflation or manage to restrict it to the lower end of the spectrum -- schools like Reed. Shabab decided that he needed to get some work experience that could serve as a better signal of his abilities than his grades.</p>
                <p>At Reed, he found numerous grants, fellowships and other resources to pursue internships over the summer. However, since Reed did not provided academic credit for such work, it would not be feasible to attempt to find an internship during the semester.</p>
                <p>There was another problem.</p>
                <p>Originally from Bangladesh, Shabab is an international student. As any other international student, he is well versed in US Immigration 101 – if a job is not directly a part of his academic program, he does not have work authorization for it during the semester.</p>
                <p>Shabab laid out his plans for the next two years: he was going to take time off from Reed, enroll into an associates degree program at Portland Community College (PCC), and come back to Reed to graduate in 2015, when he expected the economy to be in slightly better shape.</p>
                <p>“One of the first things I noticed when I started at PCC was that everyone was always reminding me to finish my degree” says Shabab. At first, he found it strange to see posters across campus and programs designed specially to encourage students to stay on track to complete their degrees. He later realized that this was because there is a large number of students that don't stick around long enough to get their degrees.</p>
                <p>For some, it is likely because they need to juggle the full time commitment of being a student, with the many other full time commitments they already have as employees and parents. For others, including Shabab, going to community college isn't really about the degree.</p>
                <p>“Many of my classmates were enrolled just so they could get a particular certificate, or to learn a specific skill they needed to advance their careers.”</p>
                <p>There were many options for students to tailor their coursework to get exactly what they needed – if you don't want to take the whole 2 year associates degree in accounting, you could still take the 4-month certification. Having enrolled with the intention of getting work experience, degree completion wasn't at the top of Shabab's priorities. He applied to part-time jobs in Portland, which seemed to not be very abundant. Moreover, he found himself competing in an “over-qualified” pool of candidates – those with master’s degrees and PhDs.</p>
                <p>He soon began working at Business for Culture and Arts as a research intern. After that, he found another internship at Mercy Corp. Both of these were structured around PCC's Cooperative Education program, for which Shabab says he has a lot of respect. Additional structure and regulations were also in place due to his international student status. Mainly intended to protect students from being exploited by employers, these regulations actually made for a very productive working environment for Shabab.</p>
                <p>“Since the program required that I have specific learning objectives at my internship – I couldn't be assigned the same task everyday, I had to legally be learning something new every few weeks.”</p>
                <p>At the end of the year, Shabab completed his Associate of General Studies along with gathering extensive work experience, and forming invaluable professional connections. He attributes the summer job he was offered soon after at Business for Culture and Arts directly to his experience at PCC. After four more months as a project associate at BCA as well as a couple of months as a Research Services Intern at Americans for the Arts in Washington DC, he returned to Reed to complete his degree.</p>
                <p>This May, he received his BA in Economics from Reed along with the other graduates from the class of 2015. Having formally entered the post-graduation job hunt, he says that the experiences and connections he built during his year at PCC have definitely helped him. He acknowledges that not everyone has the privilege of being able to afford spending additional years in school. But for those who can he recommends community college as an excellent way to get certifications and working experience, while getting quite a few pre-requisite courses out of the way. He says that if he ever has a kid, his advice to them would definitely be to start at community college before beginning their bachelor’s degree.</p>

                  <h4>Hanna D&ouml;rnhofer</h4>
                  <p>Hanna remembers that when she was in second grade, her class at Brackett Elementary school in Boston, MA organized a reading competition. There was a prize for whomever read the most books during a certain time, and Hanna was ready to claim it. Unfortunately, the prize went to someone else. She doesn't remember what exactly happened – just that it was unfair, and that she was mad. She was so mad that she swore off reading altogether.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div id="storysixexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>Unlike most second-graders, Hanna held her grudge long enough for her parents to take notice – and eventually take her out of the public schooling system entirely.</p>
                <p>“Even now, I will usually just decide on something – and carry it through very strongly,” Hanna explains the theme that persists throughout the decisions that have shaped her education trajectory.</p>
                <p>Parents throughout the country are educating their children outside of traditional private and public school for various reasons. Some are not satisfied with the quality of education in schools, some have religious differences with teachers, some may have qualms with the common core testing standards. Whatever the reason, this isn't a decision made overnight. Hanna's parents had their reasons as well.</p>
                <p>Originally from Germany, Hanna's family lived in Menlo Park, California before moving to Massachusetts. Foreign nationals who spoke German as their first language, they qualified for a diversity scholarship to send Hanna to Peninsula School. She remembers this school being more like day care. Students were given the freedom to decide what activities they wanted to do – making clay pottery, woodworking, playing outside, or reading.</p>
                <p>Classrooms such as these have quickly spread around this country, and the world, often encompassed under umbrella terms like non-traditional or alternative schooling. Generally, such programs focus on holistic development of students by providing them greater freedom to carve out their own educational paths. This ethos of self-directed learning immediately struck a chord with Hanna.</p>
                <p>“I remember the moment I decided I wanted to learn to read. I grabbed a children's’ phonetics book that they had in the school, went to the corner of a room, and started trying to read.”</p>
                <p>Since it was clear that Hanna was interested in reading, even without being instructed to do so, her parents were all the more concerned when she decided to simply stop. To them, it seemed like her classroom had somehow undone all the work she had already done for herself. Additionally, ever since she started at her new school, Hanna had stopped speaking German at home. All of these signs pointed towards a direction her parents did not want her education to go.</p>
                <p>“I think of myself as a self-driven learner”, says Hanna, describing her experience being home-schooled. “That is why learning at home worked for me. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone”</p>
                <p>Although the state of Massachusetts required some validation to make sure Hanna was actually learning at home, her education had very little structure. Her mother kept tabs on things like the books she checked out from the library, and the time they spent playing chess. She ordered textbooks and other materials from a distance learning curriculum. The learning environment at home remained quite similar to Hanna's first grade experience – all the way up to ninth grade.</p>
                <p>“When I was in eighth grade, I made the decision that I wanted to go to public school.”</p>
                <p>At this point, the family had moved to Austin, Texas, where Hanna became enthusiastic about attending a magnet school specializing in the sciences, the Liberal Arts and Sciences Academy. Since she had no official records from middle school, the only transcripts she had were documents that her mom had filled out by hand, estimating her progress. Without a standardized way of discerning Hanna's academic abilities, the school decided to admit her under probation - she would take extra tutoring with her teachers after class.</p>
                <p>Despite never having had a formal, structured class in six years, Hanna had a surprisingly smooth transition into the public schooling system. Her teachers agreed that she didn't need the extra tutoring and was at par with her peers. She does admit that she felt like she was behind her classmates in math, having had her first formal math class in ninth grade. However, at the end of senior year, she had met all of the school's academic requirements, including math.</p>
                <p>Since then, Hanna has been enrolled in what would generally be referred to as the traditional schooling system. She is currently a senior biology major at Reed. Even now, Hanna tells us that self-directed learning continues to help her succeed in school, and any other project she decides to undertake. The prevalence of online learning programs, often focusing on particular job-relevant skills, has made the self-motivated learning model especially important. Currently exploring options outside of academia after Reed, Hanna is set to carve out her career path leveraging her experience in self-directed learning - just as she did for her educational path.</p>

                <h4>Gerald Scruchions</h4>
                <p>In May 2015, Oregonians woke up to an alarming headline: “<a href="http://www.kgw.com/story/news/education/2015/05/13/report-oregon-graduation-rates-holding-us-back-from-goal/27270597/">Oregon has Worst Graduation Rate in US.</a>” It <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2015/01/oregon_posts_worst_graduation.html">provoked</a> a mix of outrage, embarrassment, and resignation, and raised serious questions about why so many young people were not making it through high school and what was being done about it.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="storysevenexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>Gerald Scrutchions is an <a href="http://www.avid.org/avid-college-readiness-system.ashx">AVID</a> (Advancement Via Individual Determination) instructor and social studies teacher at <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/roosevelt/">Roosevelt High School</a>. AVID is a college preparatory program offered at 15 schools in the Portland Public Schools district.</p>
                <p>“It’s about culture,” explains Gerald, now in his second year at Roosevelt, “we’re trying – schoolwide – to teach the skills students need to be college and career ready so they have good options available to them when they graduate.” The skills training – emphasizing writing, inquiry, critical reading, collaboration, and organization – are complemented by hands-on college and financial-aid research and field trips to colleges, universities, and workplaces. “It emphasizes purpose…and learning in ways that build proficiency over time.”</p>
                <p>We know these things do create pathways to enrollment in college or career training. AVID has an enviable success rate nationally, and in Portland, the first high school class to have completed the program in 2014 (Madison High School) reported a <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/departments/curriculum/2433.htm">100% graduation rate</a>.</p>
                <p>But a lot can get in the way: the AVID approach may not be reinforced at home and poverty, parenthood, and competing priorities – including sports – can undermine both teacher and student efforts. Programs like AVID may not be enough.</p>
                <p>When we asked Gerald to name one thing that we had not yet discussed that had the potential to really help his students thrive, he replied immediately and with passion.</p>
                <p>“Food health.”</p>
                <p>That’s when things got really interesting.</p>
                <p>“Roosevelt students depend on the school as a source of nutrition – nearly 100% qualify for free- or reduced-price lunch. What we offer is just not good enough,” lamented Gerald. “So they don’t eat it, they go to McDonald’s or eat from snack carts.”</p>
                <p>“We see kids eating hot fries for breakfast and then falling asleep at 10 in the morning.”</p>
                <p>Gerald argued that <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/bond/">school modernization</a> – a <a href="http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/213404-71878-group-says-pps-fumbles-roosevelt-hs-modernization">controversial process</a> Roosevelt is in the middle of – should include improving food services for students. “We have these amazing food carts all over the city that offer better, healthier options, and could generate interest in food systems, culinary careers, or entrepreneurship – even science in the context of the new STEM [Science Technology Engineering, and Math] lab.”</p>
                <p>Gerald is spearheading a team to find ways to repurpose what is slated to be a fenced-in, sod-covered patch under the modernization plan, and turn it into raised beds – in the short term so that students can anticipate and help design the opportunities this might create. Portland maintains at least <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/nutrition/PPS_Edible-Gardens_4-2010.pdf">40 public school community gardens</a>, but all are located at elementary schools.</p>
                <p>“A lot of our problems would be solved if we just figured out better ways to feed our kids. And growing things, good food – this is part of Oregon’s heritage.”</p>
                <p>Growing food could also make STEM(s) very real.</p>

                <h2 class="storyfontcolor">Innovation: Rethinking What School Means</h2>
                <h4>Thompson Morrison</h4>
                <p>Stuart Butler’s recent <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/social-mobility-memos/posts/2015/10/23-rethinking-college-disruptive-innovation-butler?rssid=Social+Mobility+Memos">Social Mobility Memo post</a> stated “[W]e need to rethink what “college” means. The system needs much more than tweaks in financing or regulation; it requires an entirely different...model.”</p>
              </div>
              <div id="storyeightexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
                <p>Thompson Morrison, Executive Director at <a href="http://innovateoregon.org/">Innovate Oregon</a>, makes the same point about educational institutions at every level. And he and his colleagues are doing more than talking about what’s needed, they are iterating their way to a new kind of learning experience in the community of <a href="http://www.ci.dayton.or.us/">Dayton, Oregon</a>, nestled in rural Yamhill County.</p>
                <p>For the past year, <a href="http://innovateoregon.org/projects/">Innovate Oregon</a> has been working with Dayton’s high school and district leaders to create a new learning model – one that challenges 40/40/100’s premise that credentials are what matter most in our efforts to improve student achievement.</p>
                <p>“We need to move from an assembly-line process to a dynamic process that gives students a reason to be in school.”</p>
                <p>“We keep saying to them, ‘Trust us. Learn this. There’s a big prize at the end of the road.’ But they’ve [seen] many of their older brothers and sisters who’ve trusted in that promise get to the end of a four-year education...and go to work as baristas with debt that will shackle them for many, many years. They ask, ‘Why should I do that?’”</p>
                <p>Morrison argues that the goal isn’t a degree. It’s students able to learn the skills they need to solve the problems they want to solve. “It’s about relevancy,” he exclaims.</p>
                <p>That’s why Morrison has teamed up with educators, parents, students, and business leaders to reimagine how learning can happen in a community – in and out of the classroom.</p>
                <p>“You can’t just say the current state of education is awful,” he argues, you have to provide an alternative, paint a bigger picture.”</p>
                <p>Toward that end, Morrison has rolled-up his sleeves and become a teacher himself. Together with certified Dayton instructors and students, Innovate Oregon is finding ways to bring new methods and tools into the classroom.</p>
                <p>“There have been millions and millions and millions of dollars spent by many <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/09/09/100-million-mark-zuckerberg-and-an-education-experiment.html">people</a> and many <a href="http://educationnext.org/afoundationgoestoschool/">foundations</a> trying to effect change that have failed...But the tech community has proven itself capable of innovation at scale...real transformation. So we are moving the tools and processes [proven successful in the technology industry] into the school environment.”</p>

                <h4>Enter the Sprint … and Trusses</h4>

                <p>Morrison points to policy, practice, and platforms as essential elements of the change to which Innovate Oregon and Dayton’s education partners aspire, arguing that, practices are the most important of these.</p>
                <p>“<a href="http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/commoncore">Common core</a>, <a href="http://www.ode.state.or.us/search/page/?id=3298">smarter balanced</a>, these and other policy goals are still there, but it’s at the level of practice [you really have to reimagine.]”</p>
                <p>The partners launched an experiment: adopting the <a href="https://poetiosity.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/art_of_agile_development.pdf">agile development model</a> so common in the technology industry to accelerate and improve learning in a typical, rural, public school. The idea was to engage young people in learning needed skills individually as quickly as possible while working in teams on problems they care about for short, intense periods of time called sprints. At the end of the sprint, final products would be presented to peers, teachers, administrators, and community members.</p>
                <p>The agile model required a fundamental shift in the role of the classroom instructor who had to find ways to encourage learning and skill-building without “teaching” to a whole classroom from a single lesson plan. As a first step, students began using <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, which helped them master basic concepts and progress at their own pace.</p>
                <p>But what was a relevant team problem that required the use of trigonometry? One that could engage community members as well as students?</p>
                <p>The answer? Trusses.</p>
                <p>Building <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+truss&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CE0QsARqFQoTCK2s6u_o3MgCFcwqiAod3hIFqA&biw=1571&bih=755#tbm=isch&q=roof+truss+design">trusses</a> requires the use of trigonometry (whether done by humans or as is now common, algorithms), and <a href="http://www.oregontruss.com/">Oregon Truss</a> is located just eight miles from Dayton High School. A member of the school board member knocked on the company’s door and convinced an engineer to help create a classroom challenge. Students were tasked with designing a truss for a 1,000 square-foot space and roof and estimating the constructions costs.</p>
                <p>A sprint was launched.</p>
                <p>“Three weeks later, teams rolled out their designs. One team developed a complete 3-D model” – the result of a team member with 3D printer and the ingenuity to help his teammates learn <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a> so the team could effectively use the device.</p>
                <p>Morrison reported that Dayton’s agile learning experiment was “transformational.” Teachers and educators from across the school, district, and neighboring districts have since expressed enthusiasm about learning from Dayton’s experience so they, too, can emulate the process.</p>
                <p>(The next project selected by parents, teachers, students? <a href="http://thetinylife.com/what-is-the-tiny-house-movement/">Tiny houses</a>. Stay tuned...)</p>

                <h4>Where from Here?</h4>

                <p>In Dayton, plans for the state’s first Inspiration, Innovation & Invention (I3) Center, combining a digital learning lab, machine shop, and makerspace, are underway.</p>
                <p>The real innovation here, notes Morrison, is the not a curriculum, an intervention, or a teaching method, it’s a new way to approach learning – one that emphasizes purpose, invites diverse contributions, engages community.</p>
                <p>This approach “cultivates a culture of problem solving.” And that, argues Morrison, is the skill set employers all say they need. “The problems are different but the application is the same.”</p>
                <p>The model Morrison advocates is a departure from Oregon’s 40/40/100 vision and approach which is grounded in changing how the institutions help students accumulate degrees and credentials, and build expertise in specific in-demand jobs and careers. His approach favors skill-building over degree acquisition, and is less concerned with ‘skills gaps’ so often cited by employers and policy makers.</p>
                <p>“The real problem is not the disconnect [skills gap], it’s the pace of change. The rate of innovation in education is what matters and the agile approach is so much faster and so much more scaleable [than anything we’ve seen.]”</p>
                <p>Morrison acknowledges that adopting this kind of approach across education institutions at all levels is “a heavy lift” – one that will require moving beyond pilot and program to something of a social movement –  but he is confident that “everyone knows we need to go there, even if it feels uncomfortable.”</p>
                <p>When asked what 40/40/100 should be he replies, “The aspiration should be around empowering the next generation of makers and creators...how do we empower everyone to achieve greatness? How to we provide opportunities for every individual to demonstrate what they can do - help them learn what they need to learn to solve the kinds of problems they like solving.”</p>
                <p>“That’s the conversation we need to be having not just how do we get people to have credentials.”</p>
