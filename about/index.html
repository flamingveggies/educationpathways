          Can all Oregon kids graduate from high school? If state leaders have their way, we’ll soon find out. Their aim is to raise educational and skill levels – dramatically. If they succeed, there will be a lot more of us with degrees, certificates – and work we love. That’s what 40/40/100 is all about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oregon’s leaders have set ambitious targets for Oregonians: by 2025,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            40% complete a four-year college degree
          </li>
          <li>
            40% earn a two-year degree or certificate
          </li>
          <li>
            100% graduate from high school
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Reaching for these goals will help us realize a better Oregon -- with a stronger economy, healthier families, and more resilient communities.
        </p>

          Why 40/40/100?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In 2013, the pay gap between college graduates and non-college graduates <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/upshot/is-college-worth-it-clearly-new-data-say.html?_r=0">reached a record high</a>, with four-year degree holders earning nearly twice the wages of the people without degrees. The <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/report/the-college-payoff/">difference in earnings over a lifetime</a> is nearly as great: a worker with a bachelor’s degree can expect to earn $2.3 million over a lifetime compared to $1.3 million for their non-degreed counterparts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A four-year degree is <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus">no guarantee of success</a> -- wages for all but the top earners have remained <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/">flat</a> for years, while the cost of college has <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/18/290868013/how-the-cost-of-college-went-from-affordable-to-sky-high">skyrocketed</a>. But holding one is likely to lead to higher earnings, better employment options over the course of a career, increased engagement at work, and enhanced <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/galluppurdueindex-report-2014.pdf">overall well-being</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond four-year degree programs, the options for learning after high-school are <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/downloads/20141013_BeyondTheSkillsGap.pdf">growing exponentially</a>. So are the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/30/job-economy-middle-skill-growth-wage-blue-collar/14797413/">jobs available</a> to people with credentials beyond a high school diploma but short of a four-year college degree. These are called “<a href="http://www.nationalskillscoalition.org/state-policy/fact-sheets">middle skill</a>” or “<a href="http://www.valueofjobs.com/middle_income_2015/index.html">middle income</a>” jobs and they comprise over 50% of Oregon’s employment -- from microentrepreneurs and makers to electricians and organic growers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job and career prospects for people with <i>only</i> a high school diploma (or without one at all) are increasingly bleak. Their wages fell nearly 4% between <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/stagnant-wages-in-2014/">2007 and 2014</a>, continuing a <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/">three-decade downward trend</a> that has more than tripled their poverty rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why Oregon, along with many other <a href="http://strategylabs.luminafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/State-Attainment-Goals.pdf">states</a>, seeks to graduate <i>every student</i> and vastly increase the percentage of Oregonians who complete a credential or degree beyond high school.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve got some distance to travel to achieve these goals. It is against this backdrop we offer a look into the educational pathways of the 41,603 students – most in the Oregon high school class 2006 – and the stories of Oregonians who would like to see us do (much) better.

      <h2 class="text-center bluefont">This Project Was Built 100% by Volunteers</h2>
      <p>All Hack Oregon projects are open source, built entirely by volunteers from our local community.</p>
      <p>Although each of our projects require a slightly different blend of talents and resources, our teams are always interdisciplinary and always have roles available for people at all levels of experience.  We place our team members by balancing the skills they want to contribute with the skill they want to learn &mdash; and by operating outside of normal bureaucratic, client-based, or venture funded restrictions &mdash; we're free to move fast and innovate faster.</p>
      <p>It's not always easy, but we think it's pretty worth it.</p>
